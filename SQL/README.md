# Database Generation
AwakeMUD requires MySQL v5 to function. Install it and set up your root user, then run the script in this directory to populate the Awake databases.

## Migrations
If you have a previously-installed database, check the Migrations directory to ensure that all of the scripts there have been applied to your database.
