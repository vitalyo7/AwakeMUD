Name:	Baxter Morgan, the Junkyard's supervisor
RoomDesc:$
A slouching hulk of an old man sits here, barely contained by his overalls. 

~
LookDesc:$
Few words can describe such a being. "Grungy" would be too kind; "grimy", too
evocative of a street urchin, the likes of which would be roundly offended to
be compared with Baxter Morgan. Slobbish, boorish, and with a shock of matted
grey-black hair, Baxter stares out at the world through jaundiced eyes that
vie with his teeth in an eternal competition to see which of the two can be
yellower. His overalls, tattered and oil-stained, strain at the seams as he
slouches carelessly behind his desk.

A makeshift security drone trundles around, its wheels grinding in the gravel.

LookDesc:$
Expertly welded together from the parts of ten different commercial drones,

intimidating trespassers and the occasional stray dog as they approach the
chain-link gate.

Name:	Hollow Scythe
RoomDesc:$
A spindly man with a rat's-head tattoo roots around restlessly. 

~
LookDesc:$
Twitchy and beady-eyed, this too-thin man bears the mark of having spent far
too many nights on the streets. His unkempt snarl of stringy blond hair falls
limply around his bony shoulders, leaving oily marks on his ragged robe. The
tattoo of a black rat's head ripples on the back of his left hand as he
clenches and unclenches his fist repeatedly.

RoomDesc:$
A Night-One scavenger furtively works to loosen a chunk of scrap. 

~
LookDesc:$
Scruffed-up and scraggly, this pale female Night-One has rubbed oil and dirt
into her fur in an attempt to be less noticeable. Her outfit is serviceable
enough for junkyard scavenging, consisting of heavy denim and canvas with a
belt of padded homemade tools for silent disassembly. A wicked-looking bat
with nails sticking out of it seems to be her primary mode of defense.

A tired-looking Junkyard employee is detaching usable parts from a wreck.

LookDesc:$
Looking like he's badly missing a cup or two of soykaf, this dwarven male's
baggy eyes and sallow complexion are barely concealed by the wiry chestnut
beard exploding from his chin. He's burly and stoutly-built, and despite his
exhaustion manipulates the scrap with apparent expertise.
