Name:	Welcome to Awakened Worlds!
Desc:$
    Welcome to Awake CE. This room stands on the event horizon of a great
rift, the rift connecting our world to that which lies beyond. You stand now
at the sole entrance to this realm. As you explore these hallowed halls, you
will discover everything you need to know to survive in the cruel, cold world
the Earth has become in what is our present - midway through the 21st century.
Mind you, here you will only be taught the theory of what you must do. Living
long enough to learn how to apply it is completely up to you. Welcome, and
good luck.
 ^n   Type ^WNORTH^n or ^WN^n to continue on your journey.

Desc:$
   First things first: You'll want to know how to interact with your new
world. To look around at your surroundings, just type ^WLOOK^n (or ^WL^n for short).
This will give you the description of the area you are in and show any
objects, people, and/or monsters in the same area. You can also look more
closely at things-- try ^WLOOK SIGN^n for more information!
 ^n  When you look at a room, you'll see a list of exits at the bottom of the
description. In order to move around, just type in the name of the direction
you wish to travel, such as north, south, east, west, up, or down. If there is
not a path in that direction, the MUD will let you know. Sometimes, there
might be a door in the way; if there is, you can try '^WOPEN DOOR (direction)'^n
to clear your path. Feel free to try this with the door to the east!
 ^n  To continue, go north (by typing ^WNORTH^n or ^WN^n).

Name:	Getting To Know Yourself
Desc:$
   The next thing you need to know is how to find out information about
yourself. First, take a moment to look at your character's scorecard with
^WSCORE^n. This tells you vital information about your character. If you need help
interpreting it, ^WHELP SCORE^n is a great resource. Other useful commands are
^WINVENTORY^n (or ^WI^n), ^WEQUIPMENT^n (or ^WEQ^n), and ^WSKILLS^n (or ^WSK^n). These will tell you
about what you're carrying, what you're wearing, and what you're good at.
   It's also handy to know how to interact with the things you find in the
world. You can pick up items you see on the ground with ^WGET (item)^n, or get
them from containers with ^WGET (item) (container)^n. Take a look in the hopper on
the wall (^WLOOK IN HOPPER^n)-- there's something in there for you.
   Go ahead and give those commands a try. Once you're ready, you can continue on
to the north.

Name:	Interacting in the Shadowrun Universe
Desc:$
   The Shadowrun universe is set in the year 2064. International
mega-corporations have gained control of the systems of power, surpassing the
authority of entire nations. The newly-rediscovered practices of magic,
combined with wide-spread corruption and graft, have allowed them to cement
their hold over the world. Life is cheap, and as someone who runs in the
shadows of this world, you'll need to keep yourself in peak condition to stay
alive. This floor of the tutorial will allow you to customize your character,
working with everything from attributes to skills, and even the
newly-rediscovered practice of magic.

room trains characters with the skills for operating and firing guns. Type

firearms is still present in the world of 2060. Anything larger than a simple
pistol is very likely to attract unwanted attention from law enforcement. It

Name:	The Path of the Mundane
Desc:$
   So you weren't born with magical abilities. Who needs 'em? Mundanes can
augment themselves with cyberware and bioware, artificial enhancements, to
greatly increase their physical and mental capabilities. Mundanes also can
excel at tasks mages and Adepts can't- rigging vehicles and hacking into the
Matrix, the virtual reality system of computers, for example. Cyberware
detracts from the character's essence, representing the loss of humanity of a
character after installing foreign, unnatural objects into their bodies.
Cyberware and bioware may not be for everybody, as cyberware installation is a
sickening process. For those who can stomach it, however, the possibilities
are great. Continue WEST to learn more.

   STREET SAMURAI- A general term that refers to any character that installs
cyberware into their bodies to augment their fighting capabilities. These
characters tend to be the most combat intensive of the Shadowrun archetypes.
   DECKERS- The futuristic hacker, DECKERS hack into the Matrix, an artificial
reality system of computers similar to the World Wide Web. DECKERS connect
their minds into the computers themselves through machines called CYBERDECKS
and DATAJACK cyberware.
   RIGGERS- The futuristic mechanic, RIGGERS can synchronize their mind with
those of vehicles, effectively controlling vehicles and drones with their
VEHICLE CONTROL RIGS and REMOTE CONTROL DECKS. Riggers can become quite
formidable with a legion of machines backing them up.

Name:	Cyberware Central
Desc:$
   Cyberware is one of the Sixth World's greatest achievements, blending man
and machine, working together seamlessly, to bring otherwise mundane metahumans
up to levels only dreamed of by even the most powerful adept or mage. It is not
without its drawbacks however, along with costing a lot of nuyen, it also takes
up essence. Essence is a measurement of how much your spirit binds with your
body. Everyone starts with 6 essence and it cannot be raised. If your essence
ever drops to 0, your spirit flees your body and you die. Low essence also
makes it hard for beneficial spells to bind with your body.

Name:	The Path of the Adept
Desc:$
   Adepts, also referred to as Somatic Mages, are awakened people who focus
their magic inward, unlike hermetic and shamanic mages who focus their magic
into the world. This allows adepts to seem superhuman, like the heroes in
martial arts movies. Adept powers range from straight out killing to healing.
Like all awakened beings however, their powers are hampered by cyberware and
bioware, which should be avoided as they cause random ability loss.

Name:	The Path of the Magician (Shamanic)
Desc:$
   Following the Awakening in 2019, the world experienced a surge of magical
energy. In addition to the emergence of metahuman races such as elves,
dwarves, and trolls, mankind once again became capable of manipulating magical
energy from the Earth. Two divisions of mages formed: Hermetic Mages, who view
magic as a science and approach it in a scientific manner, and Shamans, who
consider magic to be more spiritual in nature. In Shadowrun, mages are capable
of casting spells, conjuring spirits or elementals to aid them, and also
astral projection, which will be explained later in the tutorial.

   Hermetic Mages consider magic to be like a science: because they know spell
formulas and are capable of managing the complex computations in their heads,
Hermetics usually consider magic to be theirs to use and manipulate. Hermetics
are capable of conjuring elementals, if they have access to a hermetic library
and various conjuring materials. The strength of the earth, fire, wind, or
water elemental depends on the force of the library used, and the abilities of
the summoner. Hermetic mages are also capable of astral projection and
perception.

Desc:$
   As a Hermetic mage, you specialize in the conjuring of elemental spirits
through the use of hermetic circles and conjuring libraries. Your elementals
do not fade with the sun, but instead will wait in the metaplanes for as long
as you desire.
 ^n  Your elementals can be ordered to perform services with the^W ORDER^n
command. Most orders take up a service, and once you exhaust the number of
services you have contracted the elemental to provide, it will be released
from your service. Note that elementals can be killed, and if they are then
you will lose any remaining services that elemental owed you.
 ^n  As a hermetic mage, you are able to ^WCONTEST^n for control over elementals
summoned by other hermetic mages. Successfully contesting for control will
gain you whatever services remained to the elemental's summoner.

Name:	All About Shamanic Magic
Desc:$
   Totemic Shamans consider magic to be of a spiritual nature: their Totem,
through its divine knowledge, calls upon its loyal services to carry out its
will. Shamans are capable of conjuring spirits based on the domain of their
immediate surroundings. If they were in a forest, for example, they could
conjure up a Forest spirit. Likewise, if they were in the mountains they could
conjure a Mountain Spirit, or if they were in the city streets they could
summon a Spirit-of-Man. Shamans are also capable of astral projection and
perception. All Shamans must abide by the rules set forth by  their Totem.
Failure to obey the Totem, or deviation from the Totem philosophy,  will
result in the loss of magic abilities by the Shaman.

Name:	Spellcasting (Hermetic)
Desc:$
   The two main commands that mages of either type will use the most is
CONJURE and CAST. Take your time to read the help files now.  There are a lot
of factors that affect casting success, depending on your condition and the
spell being cast. Some spells are dependent on their victims stats, set
targets, or even their essence (Most health spells follow this). There are 3
types of spells, Instant, which effects happen as soon as you cast them;
Sustaining, which will stay in affect for as long as you concentrate; and
Permanent, which require you to concentrate for a set period of time before
the affects can not be undone.
   Concentrating on a spell distracts you from other tasks, and if it's not
being sustained by a spirit or focus (explained later) it will cause you to
have a harder time doing things that require concentration.

Name:	Managing Your Bank Account: ATMs and Credsticks
Desc:$
   The world of 2060 is all about nuyen (the standard currency in this world).
Managing your finances is an important aspect of running the shadows. People
who carry their life savings with them all the time tend to lose it very
quickly.
   Characters can store their funds in bank accounts. At an ATM, type BALANCE
to see how much money is in the account, DEPOSIT to deposit your funds, or
WITHDRAW to make a transaction.
   Credsticks, small pen shaped credit cards, are also a safe way to store
money. Credsticks can be personalized by someone to keep their funds safe, but
can also be rigged by someone who is proficient in ELECTRONICS. To personalize
a credstick, simply ACTIVATE it. If the credstick has already been activated,
you must CRACK the security with your ELECTRONICS skill before you can access
the nuyen within. You can use credsticks to make purchases, although some
illegal street dealers will only accept rolls of nuyen.
   To move funds from a credstick to an ATM, type "TRANSFER <amount> ACCOUNT".
To transfer funds from an ATM to a credstick, type "TRANSFER <amount>
CREDSTICK".

    The radios used by Shadowrunners in 2064 are specialized Matrix terminals
linked through the Shadowland network. This allows them heavy security from
most normal law enforcement agencies, but it is still possible to track
someone down through it.
   Radio's are an IN-CHARACTER form of communication: disregard the way you
behave and think about how your character would act.
   To operate a radio use the RADIO command. This will show you it's current
settings. To center the radio at a frequency (the most common is 8mhz), type
RADIO CENTER <frequency>. To scan through all frequencies type RADIO SCAN.
Encryption rating can be set by typing RADIO CRYPT <rating>. Only radios with
an encryption rating greater than or equal to what you have it set at can
receive them.
   To broadcast a message type BROADCAST <message>. Turning the radio off can
be accomplished with RADIO OFF. 
   You have been issued a radio for free! Don't buy one later.

Desc:$
   There are a few entries on the score sheet that may not be obvious.
   Karma is basically your experience in the world, you gain more by killing
other people and completing Shadowruns, how you go about this is up to you.
Your total karma is divided into two sections; Reputation, the karma gained
through performing Shadowruns and Immortal Awards; and Notoriety the karma
gained through killing. Reputation affects the maximums amount of PowerPoints
adepts can get, what Shadowruns you can do and other things, Notoriety affects
nothing.
   Essence Index is the amount of Bioware you can handle before you start
having negative affects, like slow healing, illness, etc. It is equal to your
Essence + 3. Essence is the amount of humanity you have left, or how well
attached your spirit is to your body, cyberware will reduce it. As your
essence drops so does your magic rating, and the amount that beneficial magic
will affect you. Bioware Index is the amount of Bioware your body can take,
bioware also reduces magic like cyberware, but only at half the value you have
installed.
   Awakened Characters also have a Grade, which is how many times they have
initiated, this is explained later.

   In the world of Shadowrun, the physical world is just one of many facets of
reality. With the resurgeance of magic and amazing advances in technological
development, whole new worlds have been opened up for the people of 2060.
Riggers can directly connect their minds with their vehicles, essentially
"becoming" their cars. Deckers can similarly connect their minds with
machines, specifically the artificial reality construct known as the Matrix.
The Matrix, a global connection of the world's computer systems, is a virtual
world that directly stimulates the senses of the Deckers enter use it through
technology called Simsense. Magically attuned characters like mages and Adepts
are also capable of interacting with the Astral Plane, a metaphysical realm
that mirrors the real world. Through the Astral Plane, mages can leave their
physical bodies and sense life-force and auras of all living things that they
come into contact with. Head on SOUTH to learn more about these worlds that

Name:	The Astral Plane
Desc:$
   Awakened Character, Hermetic and Shamanic Mages and Adepts, have access to
the astral plane in some form. Aspected Mages and magicians can only perceive
the astral plane, while full mages can fully remove their spirit from their
bodies and explore the astral plane freely.
   PROJECT and PERCEIVE are used to perform these actions. To stop projecting
type RETURN, to stop perceiving toggle it off again with PERCEIVE. Astral
Perception makes concentrating on both the physical and astral planes
difficult and gives you penalties to any actions that involve concentration.
While projecting your essence will slowly decrease, at a rate of 1 per mud
hour. If it falls to 0 you will die. It returns at a rate of 1 every mud hour
while in your physical body however. There are various actions that can only
be undertaken while in the astral plane, these are explained to the WEST.

Name:	Decking: There is No Spoon
Desc:$
   Decking is a fairly complex art, almost a whole game unto itself. To
connect to the matrix, find a room that mentions a dataport and CONNECT. From
there you have a variety of options: You can LOCATE another host, then LOGON
to it. You can attempt to LOCATE files and DOWNLOAD them.
   But first you need a cyberdeck and four 'persona' programs - body, evasion,
sensors and masking. You must INSTALL these programs to access even the most
basic of hosts. Once you get started, you'll realize that a lot of operations
fail. To improve your chances of succeeding, you can add additional utilities
to your deck. Use the SOFTWARE command to get the values and names of software
you have installed.
    See the help files: MATRIX, IC, CYBERDECKS, PROGRAMS, UTILITIES, LOCATE,
LOGON, ANALYZE, DOWNLOAD, SOFTWARE and RUN for more information.

Name:	Rigging: Danger! Danger, Will Robinson!
Desc:$
   Rigging is a complex task. A rigger must acquire three things before they
can even think about rigging: a Vehicle Control Rig, and Datajack, and a
Remote Control Deck. Once those are acquired, they simply need to purchase a
vehicle or a drone. First the rigger must register the vehicle with the
SUBSCRIBE command to add it to their RC deck. When subscribed, a vehicle will
be given a control number. To start controlling a vehicle on your SUBSCRIBE
list, type CONTROL (number of the vehicle). To adjust the speed at which you
are traveling, type SPEED (idle/cruise/speeding/max). To return back to your
physical body, type RETURN. While in control of a vehicle, it is possible to
attack those who are hostile with the RAM function. Excessive ramming will
result in damage to the vehicle. If the vehicle is destroyed while the rigger
is in control of it, he will suffer extreme damage known as DUMPSHOCK, in
which his brain is wracked by the damage sustained while in control of the
vehicle. Weapons can also be attached to a drone, providing a safer method of
attack.

UPGRADE, UNINSTALL, ATTACH, TARGET, and REPAIR.

    Driving is not too different from rigging. To enter a vehicle, first
UNLOCK the door and ENTER it. To begin driving, type DRIVE. To adjust speed,
type SPEED (idle/cruise/speeding/max). To defend yourself from someone who's
attacking your vehicle, you can RAM him, which will result in damage to your
vehicle. If your vehicle is destroyed, all passengers will be flung out into
the street, where they will take heavy crash damage in addition to being in
the unenviable position of confronting whatever destroyed their vehicle. In
the world of 2060, the isolated city-state of Seattle is surrounded by
unfriendly nations, all of which firmly patrol their borders and shoot
intruders on sight. It is not recommended that you attempt to drive past a
border fortification.

   The man in this room also can sell a vehicle to you if you have the money
for one. He won't give you the actual car itself, but he will give you a TITLE
that you cash in for a vehicle at the end of the area. Driving isn't
essential, however, as Seattle boasts an effective cab system: simply type
HAIL when you're out on the street to flag down a cab.

Desc:$
   Most doors in 2064 are Maglocks, Magnetic Locks. Keys normally take the
form of a passcode, biometric scan or keycard. Tumbler locks still exist, but
they are so rare as to be considered obscure knowledge.
   Doors can be locked and unlocked using the LOCK and UNLOCK commands,
directions or door names can be used as arguments. To "pick" a lock you use
the BYPASS command. To do this you need an electronics kit however.
   It is also possible to kick or shoot doors down, using the KICK or SHOOT
commands. Also, the KNOCK command can be used to alert someone on the other
side of a closed door.

   This area sells everything you could possibly need as a neophyte. The rooms
around you offer various types of equipment. Buy what you need before
continuing, you lose any money you have left once you leave the guild.
   You buy items from stores using the BUY command, and sell items back using
the SELL command. VALUE is used to give a rough estimate of how much you will
get payed for an item. INFO will show a brief explanation of what a item is,
it's ratings, etc. CHECK and RECEIVE are used along with availablity to see
how long is remaining until an item arrives and to receive delivery of it.
   If an item has a time listed in the "Availability" column then it is
subject to an availablity test. The time listed is the least amount time it
will take, the better you score on the availablity test the less time it will
take.
   Once ordered you can go about your business as normal, even log off, it
will be available in the amount of time the shopkeeper responds. All time
listed is MUD time.

   This section of the Neophyte Guild will teach basic combat. Characters who
have high QUICKNESS, INTELLIGENCE, and REACTION will tend to get more attacks

a weapon that deals stun damage, you will only stun your opponent instead of
killing them. Killing should only be initiated on MOBs (mobiles, computer
controlled non-player characters). All your kills with gain you a fraction of 
a karma point, but also increases your NOTORIETY. And don't even think about trying
to start a fight with another player unless you both have toggled your
player-killer flags- you won't do any damage at all, whereas your opponent will
be able to hurt you. Continue SOUTH to learn more about combat.

Name:	Melee Combat Tutorial
Desc:$
   This section will teach you about basic, same-room combat. When both
opponents are in the same room, you can initiate a fight with the KILL
command. If both characters are using melee weapons, they'll just duke it out.
Likewise, if both characters are using firearms, they'll take turns shooting
at each other. However, if one character is using a melee weapon and their
opponent has a firearm, they will need to "close the distance" before they can
try to attack their opponent. It is difficult to attack someone with a sword
if they happen to be spraying you with full automatic fire. Your success at
closing the distance between the attackers is dependent on your QUICKNESS
rating. As such, attributes like QUICKNESS, INTELLIGENCE, and WILLPOWER are
all very important for combat. BODY is also important for determining damage
resistance, and STRENGTH is useful for increasing the power of your attacks if
you're using a melee weapon.
   Combat can also be initiated in other ways: Casting a combat spell on
someone will start a fight, and casting spells in the middle of combat
requires intense concentration- the harder the spell, the longer it will take
to cast it.

Desc:$
   Tested your basic combat abilities on those training robots? Now it's time
to learn about ranged attacks. If you're using a ranged weapon like a firearm,
you can attack people from other rooms. Type SCAN now to see WEST into the
Shooting Range. You can hit people in other rooms with the SHOOT command. To
fire at someone, type SHOOT (target) (direction). Naturally, it is more
difficult to shoot someone from far away than it is if they're in the same
room: gun accessories like smartlinks, laser sights, gas vents, and scopes can
make the task easier. If a mage has a direct line of sight, they can also cast
a combat spell from a distance. Type syntax is CAST '(spell)' (target)
(direction). The same can be done from Astral Space against an Astral form.
Practice ranged combat here if you want, and head SOUTH to learn more about
combat.

Name:	Advanced Combat Tactics: Tips for Survival
Desc:$
   Combat can be a difficult task. Thankfully, this section teaches you some
commands that can make survival easier. If you've gone in over your head and
started a fight with someone that you're losing, you can FLEE to try to run
away. Fleeing will attempt to move your character out of the room through a
random exit- you may escape the fight, or you may run into more opposition if
you're not careful. For a more precise, but more difficult method of escaping
combat, try to RETREAT. You can run away from a specific direction if you try
to RETREAT (direction). The WIMPY command can be used to set your character to
automatically flee once they're wounded enough. 
   What if you don't want to run away from a fight? To avoid getting hit, you
have a COMBAT POOL. Your COMBAT POOL is determined by your QUICKNESS,
INTELLIGENCE, and WILLPOWER attributes. In combat, your COMBAT POOL will add
dice to either your defense (allowing you to dodge attacks) or offense
(allowing you do deal more damage, or hit someone) dice rolls. To set your
combat pool, type DEFENSE.
   Wounds: The weapons in Shadowrun all have a set, realistic damage rating:
Light, Moderate, Serious, and Deadly. Based on the skill of your weapon
handling, you can increase the amount of damage you deal to an opponent. For
example, someone who is skilled enough with a Light weapon can make it deal
Moderate, Serious, or even Deadly damage if they're good enough. A weapon is
only as good as its user.

Desc:$
    You're about to enter the Disclaimer area. It is vital that you read
everything in the following area carefully. Awake exists for the enjoyment of
the players and the staff: when people fail to obey the rules, they ruin the
enjoyment of other players, which ruins the enjoyment of the staff, which in
turn will forcibly ruin the enjoyment of the offender with strict punishment,
and if the situation is serious enough, banning. We are not kidding around,
and we are dead serious about this. Continue NORTH.

   In the world of 2060, everyone has something that needs to be done. People
with money can hire Shadowrunners like you to do their task for them instead
of getting their own hands dirty. Ricky's Eatery, a fairly dingy fast food

   In Awake, and in the Shadowrun Universe, the main source of karma and money
is from a Shadowrun. Shadowruns are jobs or missions provided by middlemen
known as Johnsons. In Awake, Shadowruns are automated by the AUTOJOHNSON
system. Type HELP SHADOWRUN for more information on jobs. The Immortal Staff
also holds Roleplaying Events on a very regular basis here: always be on the
lookout for opportunities to roleplay, and don't be surprised at all if the

Name:	Inside Ricky's Kitchen
Desc:$
   Participating in Immortal-held Roleplaying Events, in combination with
Autojohnson Shadowruns, a character will earn Karma. Karma can be used to
increase character attributes and skills, provided the character can find
appropriate trainers and teachers outside of the Neophyte Guild. Karma is
divided into two values: Reputation is "good" karma that you earn from jobs
and events, Notoriety is "bad" karma that you gain by killing people. To
discourage power gaming, characters with too much notoriety (more than the
repuation value) will be given a Power Gaming flag on their characters, which
will significantly reduce their ability to carry out tasks like fighting.
There are plenty of Autojohnsons out there in the Seattle Metroplex, which
means there are plenty of job opportunities for characters.

Mildew and mold grows on the walls in abundance, and waste water drips down
from the ceiling into wet puddles on the floor. The area is barely

opening covered by a slightly-visible field of red light.  The building itself
is made of a greyish stone, and has no visible windows on this side of the
building.  
   Brand new characters should check out the Dante's Inferno nightclub for
quick, simple work to build their reputation in the shadows, and also to
develop contacts with other characters. To travel around the city, you can
HAIL a cab outside, get inside, and tell the driver where you want to go.

     Every decker knows that a CYBERDECK isn't complete without PERSONA chips.
These chips determine your attributes in the MATRIX, your ability to withstand
attacks, sense your surroundings, and hide yourself from the IC.  The maximum
rating of any of these chips is the MPCP of your CYBERDECK, and the combined
ratings of all the chips cannot exceed MPCP x 3. 
   Just to the east in the basement you see a much cleaner lab staffed by a
more professional man, perhaps the higher-quality chips can be had over there.

Name:	Spirit Combat
Desc:$
   Spirits are very dangerous in combat, especially to people without any
astral abilities. They have an immunity to physical weapons so can only be
effectively attacked in the astral plane. Mages can also BANISH spirits, any
mage can banish any spirit or elemental, even if they could not normally
control them.
   Banishing is dangerous to both parties however, as it can cause the mage to
temporarily lose magic, and if reduced to no magic, they may suffer permanent
magic loss.
   Any spirit that is banished is gone forever.

Name:	Aspected Mages
Desc:$
   Aspected Mages are people who have not fully awakened, they only have
access to part of the astral plane. Because of this no Aspected mage can
project, and they are very limited to what they can do with mage. Conjurers
can only conjure elementals and Sorcerers can only cast spells.
   Shamanists are a shaman only aspect, and they only have access to spells
and spirits that their totem gives them a bonus for.
   Elementalists are the most complex of the aspects, they are a purely
hermetic aspect. They can only cast spells and conjure spirits that correspond
to their element; Fire is Combat; Earth is Manipulation; Water is Illusion and
Air is Detection. No elementalist can cast Health spells.
   Aspected magicians can still astrally perceive and banish any spirit or
elemental.

Name:	Astral Projection
Desc:$
   Full Mages have complete access to the astral plane in the form of Astral
Projection. The mages leave their body behind and travel purely in spirit
form. This allows them to access areas they otherwise couldn't. When in astral
space, they can't interact with the physical plane in anyway, they are
completely non-corporal. Astral forms may MANIFEST though, which allows them to
be seen by people without astral vision, they can also be heard, though the
voice is purely in their head and can't be recorded.
   Only Mana based spells can be cast in astral space, and then, they can only
be cast on astral or dual beings, purely physical bodies cannot be targeted
from the astral plane. All drain taken in the astral plane causes physical
damage, regardless of force. You can also TRACK astral signatures in the
astral plane.

Name:	Bonding Foci
Desc:$
   Foci are magical artifacts that help with spell casting. They can only be
used by a mage that has previously bonded them. The "HELP FOCI" file covers
them in more detail. Foci cost karma and time to bond, if you don't have
enough karma you will be told how much you need. Also, in Character Generation
you can bond Foci with Force Points.
   If you find a foci bonded by another mage, you can TRACK it back to its
owner with astral tracking or rebond it, which severs its link with its
previous owner and makes it usable by you.

   Combat spells are quick and dirty. They are designed specifically to
release mana in the most destructive fashion possible. They require little
concentration to cast, just the ability to channel a lot of mana quickly. Mana
and stun spells only affect living targets, where as the others affect all
targets. Combat spells are represented by the Fire element.

There are two methods for this, initiation or buying them with karma.
Powerpoints cost an adept 20 karma, and only 1 can be bought for every 50

to award them to you. Initiation will be covered later as it affects all

power can be toggled on and off using the NERVESTRIKE command. While toggled
on, the adepts hand-to-hand combat will do no damage, but follow rules for
Nerve Strike. if the adept is wielding anything Nerve Strike will not be
triggered.
   To use the Empathic Healing power the HEAL command is used, this requires a
target that is either lying down or unconscious. Pain relief uses the RELIEVE
command, and also requires a lying or unconscious target. Boosted attributes
are boosted by typing BOOST and then the name of the attribute that requires
boosting. Adepts with the Astral Perception power can also astrally perceiving
using the PERCEIVE command.

Name:	Armour
Desc:$
   There are two kinds of Armour in the world of Shadowrun; Ballistic and
Impact. Ballistic protects against bullets. Impact protects against slower
moving projectiles like arrows, fists, swords and explosions.
   Once more than one piece of armour is being worn at once a process known as
layering takes place. The highest rating piece of armour is applied in full,
then half the value of all other pieces is applied. The full total of all
pieces is used to calculate penalties though.
   If the un-layered value of your ballistic or impact armour values is greater
than your modified quickness you begin to experience penalties due to your
movement being restricted. You will move slower, lose combat pool, and have a
harder time using quickness based skills like athletics or ranged combat. Form
fitting armour is not included in the calculations for layering penalties
however.

Name:	Astral Actions
Desc:$
   Assensing is the process of carefully looking at the aura of a person,
spell or object and discerning otherwise unknown information from it. It can
be used to find out how much of a persons spirit remains in their body, the
location of any cyberware, who cast a spell and what force. Anything that is
magically active has an aura and so can be assensed.
   ASSENSE is the command used to perform this action. People, foci, hermetic
circles, lodges, spirits and spells can all be assensed for more information.
In fact you may wish to assense them before taking further action, so you don't
end up a big astral stain. The help file contains more information on the use
of this command.
   Astral Tracking is the process of taking a spell aura, and finding the
source. It can track anyone, anywhere in the world, as long as you have an
astral link to them, this can be a spell they've cast, foci, a conjured
spirit, or even a shamanic lodge, anything they've left an astral signature
on. It takes time to TRACK someone, and if it takes more time than you can
stay projected due to essence loss you will have to resume again later.

Desc:$
   Eye modification is a booming business in 2064, anything from cosmetic
modification to retinal duplicators to image magnification. If eye
modifications are bought in a package, essence reductions apply, so it is
usually best to do it this way. However, not always can you find your desired
modification in a package and will have to buy it separately. All vision
modifiers given by cyberware is treated as natural vision, and as such, mages
with electronic magnification cannot cast any spells that require line of
sight without projecting or perceiving.

Desc:$
   Bioware aims to replace biological systems in your body with improved, man
made versions. This process is very complicated as it requires the new organs
to be matched closely to your body's existing biological makeup. While bioware
can offer great benefits, it is far more dangerous than Cyberware. Where
excessive Cyberware leads people to be very emotionally detached and
psychotic, Bioware causes intense physical problems. Lowered resistance to
diseases, longer healing periods and less resistance to deadly damage. All
characters can have a maximum of 9 Body Index points of Bioware. But once it
starts to exceed Essence Index (Essence + 3) the severe drawbacks begin to
kick in.

Name:	The Path of the Magician (Hermetic)
Desc:$
   Following the Awakening in 2019, the world experienced a surge of magical
energy. In addition to the emergence of metahuman races such as elves,
dwarves, and trolls, mankind once again became capable of manipulating magical
energy from the Earth. Two divisions of mages formed: Hermetic Mages, who view
magic as a science and approach it in a scientific manner, and Shamans, who
consider magic to be more spiritual in nature. In Shadowrun, mages are capable
of casting spells, conjuring spirits or elementals to aid them, and also
astral projection, which will be explained later in the tutorial.

Name:	Spellcasting (Shamanic)
Desc:$
   The two main commands that mages of either type will use the most is
CONJURE and CAST. Take your time to read the help files now.  There are a lot
of factors that affect casting success, depending on your condition and the
spell being cast. Some spells are dependent on their victims stats, set
targets, or even their essence (Most health spells follow this). There are 3
types of spells, Instant, which effects happen as soon as you cast them;
Sustaining, which will stay in affect for as long as you concentrate; and
Permanent, which require you to concentrate for a set period of time before
the affects can not be undone.
   Concentrating on a spell distracts you from other tasks, and if it's not
being sustained by a spirit or focus (explained later) it will cause you to
have a harder time doing things that require concentration.

Name:	Conjuring (Shamanic)
Desc:$
   As a Shaman, you possess the unique ability to summon the spirits of your
surroundings wherever you are-- however, they will disappear when the sun
crosses the horizon, so be sure you're aware of the time.
 ^n  Your spirits can be ordered to perform services with the ^WORDER^n command.
Most orders take up a service, and once you exhaust the number of services you
have contracted the spirit to provide, it will be released from your service.
Note that spirits can be killed, and if they are then you will lose any
remaining services that spirit owed you. Of course, services will also be lost
when the spirit fades at sunrise or sunset.
 ^n As a shaman, you are able to ^WCONTEST^n for control over spirits summoned by
other shamans. Successfully contesting for control will gain you whatever
services remained to the spirit's summoner.

Desc:$
   Gunsmithing in Awake CE is the art of creating ammunition from raw
materials. It's a very useful skill to have when trying to obtain rare types
of ammunition that may be hard to find in the Sprawl. However, it can also be
an expensive hobby, as you don't have the benefits of bulk discounts or
specialized factory equipment backing you up. ^WHELP AMMO^n describes the various
types of ammunition and the process for creating it.

here, which cost double the standard price with the benefit of reduced essence
cost. Ranging from cosmetic cybereyes to vision modifications and image
magnification, if it has to do with eyes or vision it can be found here. If
eye modifications are purchased in a package, essence reductions apply, so it
is usually best to do it this way. However, that doesn't stop you from mixing
and matching as you please. All vision modifiers given by cyberware are
treated as natural vision.
