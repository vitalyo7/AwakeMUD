LookDesc:$
The almost-universal mark of the cyber-conscious user, standard datajacks allow 
input and output to certain pieces of cyberware and gear. Datajacks allow the 
user to cybernetically interface with properly equipped gear such as cyberdecks,
remote-control decks and vehicles with datajack ports, so that the user can
manipulate them, issue commands and so forth.
^n
Datajacks allow the user to mentally access headware memory. Contents of softs
can also be downloaded into headware memory through a datajack. Knowsofts cannot
be accessed through a datajack without a knowsoft link, datasofts cannot be
accessed without a display or image link, and activesofts cannot be accessed
without skillwires. Data fed into a datajack (from a cyberdeck, tridlinked
cybercam, vehicle and so on) can in turn be fed into a display link, image link
or headware memory.
^n
Deckers usually implant datajacks in their temples to access higher-brain
functions, while riggers usually have them behind and below the ears, where they
access the submandibular glands and lower brain. It is not unusual for some
people to have more than one datajack.~

An ASIST converter converts simsense signals (transferred through a datajack) 
into something the metahuman brain can understand, and vice versa. All 
simdecks, cyberdecks, remote control decks and other direct neural interface

Otaku who wish to jack into the Matrix without a cyberdeck need an ASIST

Dermal sheathing combines the latest advances in dermal plating technology with 
a semi-synthetic skin sheath. The result is protection that is smoother and 
less bulky than standard dermal plating, with greater self-regenerative

^n
Some dermal sheaths use a technology derived from ruthenium polymers, allowing 
the sheath to change across a wide array of colors through a low-level electric 
charge. The color display is facilitated by built-in expert logic circuitry. It 
can use input from imaging scanners to match the sheath to its owner's 
surroundings for a camouflage effect, or it can display text or images input 
from linked sources such as headware memory.~

A reflex trigger that is modified for stepped functioning allows a user to 
spend a Simple Action to turn his reflexes on and off, or switch to a lower or 
higher level of wired reflexes (but not higher than their actual level.)~
