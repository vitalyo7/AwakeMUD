A battered old battleship of a desk hunkers obstinately near the door.~
LookDesc:$
Constructed out of what appears to be painted sheet metal and lag bolts bigger
than a troll's wrist, this massive hunk of cobbled-together debris vaguely
resembles the desk that its occupant has made it serve as. Streaks of blue and
yellow enamel on a white background identify it as once belonging to "The
Sunrise Corporation".

A chunk of electronics and trailing wires has been abandoned here.~

Rough around the edges and bearing the distinct appearance of a component that
has been salvaged from a wrecked vehicle, this GridGuide unit has seen better
days. However, the interface ports look to have been recently replaced, and
the memory chips with their tiny logos are intact. Might be worth something to
the right buyer.

Someone has left a battered toolbox behind.~

Although it's seen better days, this battered-looking toolbox contains a
useful selection of tools for working on vehicles-- everything from spudgers
to 10mm sockets, and even a few heavier wrenches for the really stubborn bits.
It won't fix everything, but it's a start.
