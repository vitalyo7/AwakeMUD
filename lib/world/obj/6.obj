Keywords:	rattlesnake heavy silver crafted pistol azt
Name:	an AZT Rattlesnake
RoomDesc:$
A steel-crafted heavy pistol lies on the floor.~
LookDesc:$
The Azt Rattlesnake is a weapon of perfection. Used only by the legendary
Leopard Guards in Aztechnology's security core, these guns are impossible to
find, buy, or for that matter, be used by anyone other than a Leopard Guard.
Using a special synthetic pad on the handle of the gun, Aztechnology has made
it automatically attach itself to the user. The gun itself will not fire
unless this attachment is secure. Therefore, since this synthetic lock is one
of Aztechnology's most prized secrets, noone knows how to use them. The inside
of the gun is equally perfectly crafted. Carrying a compressed magazine of 25
"bolts", the pistol releases each crafted bullet linked to a highly
sophisticated Smartlink-Zeta prototype. On impact, the APDS-II head pierces
almost any armour produced, and ignites the explosive-flechette compound
inside. From there on, it gets pretty graphic.
