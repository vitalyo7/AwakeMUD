A Renaissance-styled dress is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
These evening gowns and cocktail dresses bring back a look popular in the
Renaissance, when threads of gold were woven into the fabric. Using the
patented Crystle weaves, the fabric seems to shimmer and even come alive.
Though the gowns come in many styles, almost all have low-cut bodices and are
backless. The length of dress varies between very short and floor length.

RoomDesc:$
A classic greatcoat is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
A classic design that placed Mortimer on the map, these heavy, waterproofed
coats are reminiscent of twentieth-century naval greatcoats. Though apparently
thick with wool and lined with silk, most of the greatcoat's weight comes from
heavy ballistic fabric and semi-rigid plates disguised by the cut of the coat.
Greatcoats are waterproofed and chemically resistant to the "hard rain" common
in many urban sprawls.
