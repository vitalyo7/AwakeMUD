Similar to the Suprathyroid, the Metabolic Arrester is a regulating gland grown 
on top of the thyroid. Under conditions where the body seems to be suffering 
from massive trauma, as measured by a severe drop in blood pressure and the 
presence of high levels of endorphins, the Metabolic Arrester supersedes the 
thyroid's metabolic functions, drastically decreasing the body's metabolic 
rate. As the heart and breathing rates slow to minimal levels and the body's 
temperature drops, the character takes on a death-like pallor. The lowered body 
functions help stave off the effects of trauma and lower nanite loss.~

The Suprathyroid Gland is a regulating gland that is grown and then implanted

(the chemical conversion of substances, such as the construction of complex 
sugars). The altered metabolism produces more energy and effectively 
supercharges the recipient. With the higher levels of energy available, 
characters with a Suprathyroid have a tendency toward hyperactivity.

RoomDesc:$
An uninstalled toxin extractor package is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
The metahuman liver is the body's main organ for catabolism, or the breakdown 
of complex substances. As such, it is the first line of defense against 
potentially toxic compounds and drugs. The Toxin Extractor is a specially 
cultivated cluster of cells implanted in the liver to greatly improve the 
efficiency and to expand the spectrum of catabolic activity. Potential toxins 
that make their way into the bloodstream are filtered out in the liver, and 
with the aid of the extractor they are broken down into harmless fragments and 
then expelled.~
