Upon further inspection, there is an engraving on the bell  which is a Bach
Stradivarius logo that is very intricate.  Etched into  the Bach 7S mouthpiece
is "Sorel" in miniscule letters.  This instrument  is a dream to play.  Sorel

Name:	Taepta'so
RoomDesc:$
A gorgeous black Katana lies here, looking lethal even in idleness.~
LookDesc:$
Taepta'so is a beautifully crafted, *VERY* high-tech Katana.  It is about the
normal length for a Katana, and the handle is wrapped tightly in a bright red
cloth.  The hilt is an oval of sculpted titanium, with two oriental dragons
chasing eachother around the blade's base.  None of these features are very
impressive, however, when compared to the blade itself.  It appears to have
been forged in the traditional fashion, (Folded around four-hundred times,
according to rumor), but that is where the similarity ends.  Rather than being
steel, this Katana's blade is a super-tough titanium alloy, and was folded by
an expert craftsman.  After the blade's shape was finished, it had a design of
a single large oriental dragon standing on Japanese script etched on both
sides with acid.  The script speaks to anyone who can read it of a legend of a
sentient sword named Taepta'so, and claims that this sword, quenched three
times in the blood of thoroughly corrupted men, is a reincarnation of it.
After this treatment, the blade was bead-blasted and anodized black. Last, but
certainly not least, the blade was sharpened to a razor edge, leaving a
gleaming ribbing pattern along the gently curving edge.

A nasty looking vehicle-mount autocannon lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The Vermicide is the entry level model in the Ares range of autocannons.
While it boasts less damage than the more expensive models, it is lighter and
remains very effective against lightly armored vehicles or well defended
infantry.  The standard model is semiautomatic, but many, including this one,
have been modified after manufacture to fire in fully automatic.

The Victory autocannon is the top of the line.  It's damage is slightly higher
than that of the Vigilant, and it weighs a fair bit more, but many people opt
for it in favor of the Vigilant simply for the overkill factor.  Nothing a
Shadowrunner is likely to get their hands on has more punch than a Victory.
